The project consists of controlling a DC motor using the Arduino UNO development board and LabVIEW. From the front panel
of the LabVIEW output the pins are selected in order to control the speed of the rotation and also the the way it can vary (clockwise or counterclockwise).
Also the LEDs help us monitoring the speed of the DC motor and the variation of the spinning direction.

Components:

-LEDs
-330 ohm resistors
-5V DC motor
-Arduino Uno R3
-l293d motor driver
